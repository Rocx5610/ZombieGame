<p> Welcome to my zombie game. This is my second game I ever made and it's just a test to see how far I am in my coding. With each game I want<br>
 to become better and better at making html
and javascript games. So enjoy this game about the zombie apocalypse.<br>
 check out my first game here <a href="https://rocx5610.github.io/CatGame-1/">My Last Game</a><br>
